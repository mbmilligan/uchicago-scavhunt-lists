# Lists from the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt

The [ScavHunt](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lore.html) has been held annually on Mothers' Day since 1987.

Each year a list of 200+ items is released. Copies of previous years' lists 
[are available](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/yore.html) online. This repository collects those, along with
a variety of supplemental materials, in a form that can easily be fetched in a single operation.
