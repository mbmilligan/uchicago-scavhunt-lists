# Lists from the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt

This branch aims to produce an all-purpose quality checking and data science environment for the compiled lists. You can clone this repository to use these notebooks locally, or CLICK HERE --> 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbmilligan/uchicago-scavhunt-lists/analysis?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FGetting%20Started.ipynb) <-- to launch a pre-made environment in the cloud. 

The [ScavHunt](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lore.html) has been held annually on Mothers' Day since 1987.

Each year a list of 200+ items is released. Copies of previous years' lists 
[are available](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/yore.html) online. This repository collects those, along with
a variety of supplemental materials, in a form that can easily be fetched in a single operation.

These files have been compiled through the efforts of members of [The Graduate Student and Alumni Scavenger Hunt Team](https://www.scavhunt.net/).
